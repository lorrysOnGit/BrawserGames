# BrawserGames
lots of funny games in javascript

currently there are only 2 games: Last defender and flappybird.

I, LorrysOnGit started the project by following a tutorial for flappy bird, and after understanding the code and the process of game making i got the initiative of making my own game, luckly my school professor scheduled a group project to do for the year, the argument of the school project was "do what you want" and so i did. 

me and my team members divided our roles: 
Davide had to do the home page;
halil the arts;
and i myself the code of my new game: "Last Defender".

Last Defender: 
Last Defender is a tower defense game were a monkey have to protect his banana storage from wild animals that want to steal his food.

the monkey is not just a monkey, his name is pit : pit the peanut shooter , with the arrow keys you can aim your shots, but remember to release to shoot; with the "a" key pit goes left, and with the "d" key he goes right; with the w key pit makes a jump ,and when he's in air if you tap 2 time the "d/a" key he is able to dash in that direction.
also, by stomping the enemy, pit is able to do a lot of damage.

tip: everytime you shoot you get a knockback effect and you can use it at your adventage(especially when shoting upwards).

there are 4 tipes of enemies that wants to give you trouble: 
elephants,moles(talpas), snakes and eagles.

the elephant is a chonky boy that will alway come in the right side of the map and he has a lot of hp to take down(the most in the game); it takes 10 stomps to kill (every stomp deals 100 damage).

the mole(talpes) come from under the ground and they do massive damage to the banana storage, they are not really fast in land and under the ground and they surely do not have massive hp(it takes 3 shots to kill and less than a stomp).
the problem is that they are high in numers.

the snake and the eagle is a totally different story, these two guy don't like bananas, thew want you and you only, the eagle will come for your head by launchin his friend snake in your face, and when the snake gets to you, it will stop you from mowing untill you kill it.

you can puse the game by pressing the p key.
